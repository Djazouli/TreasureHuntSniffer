## TODO

* Make a **Bot** class instead of using some global variables
* Catch the number of chest at the end
* Get the total distance of the Hunt
* Store interesting insights about the hunt: 
    - Time spent
    - Total Distance
    - Number of hints
    - Starting map
    - Ending map
    - Number of chest won
    - Was d0fus-hunt right on every hint ?
* Write some nice stuff to display nice statistics with the previous data
